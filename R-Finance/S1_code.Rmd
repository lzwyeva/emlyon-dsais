## Install packages

There are two steps: first you need to download the package (only once).
The packages are downloaded from servers all around the world. So we start by choosing one.

```{r CRAN_mirror, eval = FALSE}
# chooseCRANmirror()
chooseCRANmirror(ind = 1)    # Set downloading location
```

```{r packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # Install (download) package: only once
```

**NOTE** (reminder): it's easy to install packages directly in RStudio ("Tools" tab).

Then, if you want to work with it, you need to load/activate it. 
```{r load, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(tidyverse)            # Activate: each time you launch RStudio
```


## Comments and output 

- One hashtag # precedes a comment in R.   
- Two hashtags ## precede output from a code sequence in the slides.

```{r comments}
1+1 # Test!
```

In these slides, code will appear in grey areas (rectangles).


## The assignment operator <-

In R, we don't use "=" to create variables, but an arrow sign "<-".

```{r}
a <- 6 # This creates a variable but does not show it!
a      # If you want to see it, ask for it!
```


```{r}
b <- 11:42  # This creates a variable but does not show it!
b           # If you want to see it, ask for it!
```



# Tidy data via the package *tidyr* 

## Instances vs variables

The **diamonds** database is included in the tidyverse. The **head**() function shows the first lines of a dataset. The **tail**() function shows the *last* lines.

```{r diamonds}
head(diamonds, 4) # The number gives the amount of rows shown
```




## Tidy data: example via gapminder

```{r gapminder, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder") # Install (download) package: only once
```


```{r gap_minder}
library(gapminder)            # Activate: each time you launch RStudio
head(gapminder,3)             # Have a look!
```



## Tidy data: counter-example

The table below shows the evolution of population of countries. 

```{r rows.print = 4, cols.print = 4}
pivot_wider(gapminder[c(1:4,13:16,25:28), c(1,3,5)],  # Don't look at this code!
            names_from = "country", values_from = "pop")
```
   
   

## Tidy tools

The tidyverse has two functions that switch from matrix/excel format to tidy data and back:

- **pivot_longer**(): from matrix/excel to tidy data
- **pivot_wider**(): from tidy data to matrix/excel

Below, one example of data (called "not_tidy_pop"") in excel format.

```{r tidy_data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Year <- c(1970, 1990, 2010)
France <- c(52,59,65)
Germany <- c(61,80,82)
UK <- c(56,57,63)
not_tidy_pop <- data.frame(Year, France, Germany, UK)
not_tidy_pop
```

**BE VERY CAREFUL**: type case matters in R!     
"Continent" is not "continent".   



## Tidy tool: **pivot_longer**()! From wide to long.

Gather joins/concatenates columns which belong to the same variable.
```{r tidy_gather, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tidy_pop <- pivot_longer(not_tidy_pop, 
                         cols = -Year, 
                         names_to = "Country", 
                         values_to = "Population")
```

<div class="columns-2">
```{r}
tidy_pop[1:7,]  # First 7 lines (only) shown
```

The syntax is the following:

pivot_longer(**data**,  
$\quad$    **cols** = columns to tidy,    
$\quad$    **names_to** = name_of_the_new_variable,     
$\quad$    **values_to** = name_of_the_column_with_values      
)

**key** = Country because the columns are all countries.

**value** = Population because the data pertains to population values.

We use -**Year** because the Year variable is excluded from the pivoting

</div>

## Tidy tools: **pivot_wider**()! From long to wide.
The reverse operation.
```{r tidy_spread}
pivot_wider(tidy_pop, names_from = "Country", values_from = "Population")
```
pivot_wider(**data**,   
$\quad$  **names_from** = variable_to_be_put_in_columns,   
$\quad$  **values_from** = where_to_get_values  
)



# Data manipulation via the package *dplyr*

## filter() rows - Part I

Often, analyses are performed on subsets of data. 
```{r filter()}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp > 81.5) # Countries where people live long lives on average
```


## filter() rows - Part II 

Filters can be combined (with commas preferably, the & operator works, too). 
```{r filter_2}
filter(gapminder, country == "Japan", year > 2000) 
```


Only two observations for Japan post-2000.  
**NOTE**: as in **all** languages, there are **TWO EQUAL SIGNS** (==) for the comparison.  
One "=" is like the arrow (<-) and is used to **assign** values.



## select() columns 

Sometimes, you might want to keep just a few variables to ease **readability**.
```{r select(), table_red}
select(gapminder[1:5,], country, year, pop)
```
Use **select**(data, -variable) to **remove** variable: the minus sign!



## Sort via arrange() 

This is when you want to **order** your data. Here, from smallest pop to largest.
```{r arrange}
head(arrange(gapminder, pop)) # Alternative: arrange(gapminder, desc(lifeExp)); desc() is for descending
```


## Create new columns via mutate() 

With population and gdpPercap you can infer total GDP!

```{r mutate}
head(mutate(gapminder, gdp = pop * gdpPercap))
```



# Piping: %>%


## Example (short)

```{r pipe1, results = FALSE}
select(filter(diamonds, carat > 4), carat, price, clarity) # BEURK!
```

```{r pipe2}
diamonds %>%
    filter(carat > 4) %>%
    select(carat, price, clarity)  # So simple!
```


## Example (long)

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
    filter(carat > 2, cut == "Ideal") %>%      # First we filter
    mutate(car_price_ratio = carat/price) %>%  # Then, we create a new column
    arrange(desc(car_price_ratio)) %>%         # We order the data
    select(-x, -y, -z) %>%                     # We take out some superfluous columns
    head(4)                                    # Finally, we ask for the top 4 instances
```



# Pivot tables

## Definition

"*A pivot table is a table of statistics that summarizes the data of a more extensive table.*"

--- Wikipedia

There are two dimensions in a pivot table:  
- which **variable**(s) we want to analyze (gender, continent/country, size, etc.);  
- which **statistic** we want to compute (mean, min, max, number of instances, variance etc.).

In R, these two steps are separated via two functions: **group_by**() and **summarise**()

## Example I 

```{r pt1, warning = F, message = F}
diamonds %>%
    group_by(clarity, cut) %>%              # Define the variables
    summarise(avg_price = mean(price),      # Define the statistics
              avg_carat = mean(carat)) %>%  # Second stats
    head(4)
```

## Example II 

You can even pipe inside a function! 
```{r pt2, warning=F, message=F}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent, year) %>%
    summarise(avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp) %>% round(2)) %>%
    head(4)
```
The **round**() function rounds numbers up to some decimals.
